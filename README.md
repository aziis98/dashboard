## Dashboard | Introduction

### Note 1
I'm aziis98 (Antonio De Lucreziis) and this is a dashboard for keeping notes, timers and more things like those.
Here you can see two notes and a clock. Widgets like notes can be added from the menu above. You can move widgets by dragging them around. Try moving the note on the left. As you see there is a very fine grid to keep things a bit more tidy.
When a note becomes long (about over 10 lines) it get a title like this one.
Notes can be very long so at a certain point they stop growing vertically and instead a scrollbar appears.
Oh and by the way, every thing is save to localStorage so if you change something it will remain even if you reload the page.
